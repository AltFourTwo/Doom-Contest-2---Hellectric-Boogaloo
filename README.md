# Doom-Contest-2-Hellectric-Boogaloo
The map I submitted for Joel's Doom Mapping Contest in 2018

In the folder you will find the wad file I submitted.  
You will need a program like Slade 3 to view it's contents.  
Map was made for GZDoom g3.2.5, you will also need your own copy of Doom II as the base wad if you wish to try it out.  

Here's Joel actually playing my Map/Wad!  
https://youtu.be/tW0XkrPoJl8?t=10946  
Note: I think he was playing in a very low resolution to stay true to the original Doom format.  
      This caused the text to wrap badly.

This work was intended only for the purpose of participating in the contest.  
It now lies here to be part of my portfolio.
All resources were publicly available.  
Non-Commercial use only.  

The "THANKS" file within the wad can be opened with a text editor.  
Here is it's contents  

/*  
Thanks Mr. Tee for sharing your intro script!

Thanks Chris for putting together the doom 64 sound pack!

Thanks to everyone who shared knowledge on making maps and fixing things!

Things I've learned

- A good deal about level design
- Managing a handful of different resources with Slade 3  
  (Textures, sound effects, music, scripts)
- Action Code Script (ACS)
- Simple animations
- The core of Doom's engine (named Doom engine)
