# Doom-Contest-2---Hellectric-Boogaloo
The map I submitted for Joel's Doom Mapping Contest in 2018

In the folder you will find all the source files to create the wad file I submitted.  
You will need a program like Slade 3 to pack them together into a wad file.  
Map was made for GZDoom g3.2.5, you will also need your own copy of Doom II as the base wad.  

This work was intended only for the purpose of participating in the contest.  
It now lies here to be part of my portfolio.
All resources were publicly available.  
Non-Commercial use only.  

The "THANKS" file can be opened with a text editor.  
Here is it's contents
